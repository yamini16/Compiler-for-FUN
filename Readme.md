Test Case Files:
test1.fun        : Let Statement demonstration
refExample.fun   : RefType demonstration
tuple.fun        : TupleType with Projections demonstration
fact.fun         : Recursive Factorial Algorithm demonstration
fibonacci.fun    : Recursive Fibonacci Algorithm demonstration

Future Development :
TypeChecking       : Fix Error Messages in Ref Set statement. per Language specification, ref set statement type is unit, but error messages display reftp. 
Loops              : Do While loop example compiled but not working.
General Spilling   : To be implemented
Liveness Analysis  : Code needs cleaning up
Color Verification : To be implemented
